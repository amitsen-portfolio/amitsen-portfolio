    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository
    # This action checks out your repository to the GitHub Actions runner,
    # allowing the workflow to access the contents of your repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
    # This action sets up a Node.js environment for the workflow,
    # using the version specified under 'node-version'
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20.10.0'  # Specify your Node.js version here (match with your local dev environment)

    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    # This step runs 'npm install' to install all dependencies specified in your package.json file
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    # Step 4: Build the project
    # Here, we build the Next.js application by running the 'build' script defined in package.json
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    # Step 5: Run tests (Optional)
    # If you have tests set up, this step will run them. Uncomment this step if needed.
    # This step runs 'npm test', which should be configured in your package.json
    #- name: Run tests
    #  run: npm test

    # Deployment Step (Placeholder)
    # Include your deployment script here. This part should contain commands to deploy your app
    # to your hosting provider (like IONOS). Make sure to use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.
    # Uncomment and configure this step according to your deployment process.
    #- name: Deploy to IONOS
    #  run: ./deploy-to-ionos.sh  # Replace with your deployment script
