# Defines the jobs in the workflow
jobs:
  build-and-test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Specifies the runner environment to use (Ubuntu latest version)

    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the repository
    # This action checks out your repository to the GitHub Actions runner,
    # allowing the workflow to access the contents of your repository
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v4

    # Step 2: Set up Node.js environment
    # This action sets up a Node.js environment for the workflow,
    # using the version specified under 'node-version'
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      with:
        node-version: '20.10.0'  # Specify your Node.js version here (match with your local dev environment)

    # Step 3: Install dependencies
    # This step runs 'npm install' to install all dependencies specified in your package.json file
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    # Step 4: Build the project
    # Here, we build the Next.js application by running the 'build' script defined in package.json
    - name: Build
      run: npm run build

    # Step 5: Run tests (Optional)
    # If you have tests set up, this step will run them. Uncomment this step if needed.
    # This step runs 'npm test', which should be configured in your package.json
    #- name: Run tests
    #  run: npm test

    # This step adds the hosting server's SSH key to the known hosts file
    # It ensures the GitHub Actions runner recognizes and trusts the hosting server during SSH connections
    # Create the .ssh directory if it doesn't exist
    # Change the file permissions of the .ssh directory
    # Add the hosting server's SSH key to the known hosts
    # Optional: Change the file permissions of the known_hosts file
    - name: Add HOST SSH Key to Known Hosts
      run: |
        mkdir -p ~/.ssh
        chmod 700 ~/.ssh
        ssh-keyscan -H ${{ secrets.HOST_SERVER }} >> ~/.ssh/known_hosts
        chmod 644 ~/.ssh/known_hosts

    # This step installs sshpass in the GitHub Actions runner
    # sshpass is used for non-interactive ssh login, facilitating automation
    - name: Install sshpass
      run: |
        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install -y sshpass

    # Deployment Step (Placeholder)
    # Include your deployment script here. This part should contain commands to deploy your app
    # to your hosting provider. Make sure to use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data.
    - name: Deploy to host server
      env:
        SERVER: ${{ secrets.HOST_SERVER }}
        USERNAME: ${{ secrets.HOST_USERNAME }}
        PASSWORD: ${{ secrets.HOST_PASSWORD }}
        LOCALDIR: '.next'
        REMOTEDIR: ${{ secrets.HOST_REMOTEDIR }}
      run: bash deploy.sh
